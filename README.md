## ▶️ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or later
- Maven 3.8 or later (optional when using the Maven Wrapper)

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone or unzip the project
cd voice-customer-success-manager

# 2. Run the application
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# 3. Open in browser
http://localhost:8080
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

If you are using Windows, open **PowerShell** in the project directory and run:

```powershell
# Run the application using the Maven Wrapper
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

If Maven is installed globally, you can also use:

```powershell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

After the application starts, open:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

### Verify Java Installation

Run the following command to verify that Java is installed correctly:

```powershell
java -version
```

The project requires **Java 17 or later**.

### Verify Maven Installation (Optional)

If you are not using the Maven Wrapper, verify Maven with:

```powershell
mvn -version
```

### Windows-specific Troubleshooting

#### Java is not recognized

If PowerShell displays:

```text
'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```

Ensure that:

- Java 17 or later is installed.
- The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is configured.
- The Java `bin` directory is included in your system `PATH`.

#### mvnw.cmd cannot be found

Run the command from the project's root directory where the `mvnw.cmd` file is located.

#### Port 8080 is already in use

Stop the process using port **8080** or configure a different server port in `application.properties`.
